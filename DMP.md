## Projects

We will be working on the following projects and for those are the data
and work described in this DMP.

::: project
### Investigating the effects of miRNA expression in insulin-dependent rainbow trout tissues on metabolism and insulin sensitivity during methionine restriction

Start date
:   February, 2022

End date
:   April, 2022

Funding

:   -   Not funded: N/A (planned)

::: {.section .abstract}
Background: Dietary methionine restriction (MR), for over 2 decades, has
garnered interest in nutritional research due to its beneficial
metabolic phenotypes such as increased insulin sensitivity and decreased
lipid deposition. However, how dietary methionine restriction elicits
such benefits is still under study. Recent studies have implicated
epigenetic factors such as miRNAs, as a target for the MR phenotype. In
light of this discovery, few studies have been documented using
non-model organisms like the teleost fish, rainbow trout, in methionine
restriction research. For the studies that have, multiple tissues were
not investigated for altered miRNA expression during methionine
restriction to elucidate the conservation of their function across
different tissues.

Main Objectives: To investigate the effects of miRNA expression in
insulin-dependent rainbow trout tissues on metabolism and insulin
sensitivity during methionine restriction

Methodology: This will be a cross-sectional study. A total of 16
juvenile rainbow trout would be used. Their growth rate and weight be
fore and after the 8 week period would be used to determined. After the
study period of 8 weeks of being fed specific dietary regimes, they will
be euthanised, muscle, adipose and liver samples will be taken, snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at âˆ’80C until analysis. RNA was
extracted isolation of total RNA. From total RNA, MiRNA would be
quantified. MiRanda 3.0 would be used to predict miRNA- gene interaction
for the miRNA identified and quantified.

Expected Outcomes: The miRNA expression levels in various insulin
dependent-tissues during methionine restriction would be classified. The
miRNAs found in more than one tissue which is associated with the
metabolic MR phenotype would be identified.

## Section A: Data Collection

::: {#q-what-data .question}
### 1. What data will you collect or create?

::: answer
#### Data formats and types

<div>

We will be using the following data formats and types:

-   **[Ontology for MicroRNA
    Target](https://fairsharing.org/bsg-s002670)**

    It is a standardized format. This is a suitable format for long-term
    archiving. We will have only a small amount of data stored in this
    format.

::: {#q-how-data .question}
### 2. How will the data be collected or created?

::: answer
There will be no instrument dataset in this project.

#### Storage and file conventions

We will use a filesystem with files and folders with the following
folder conventions:

-   There will be a **folder for each sample/subject**.
-   There will be a **(sub)folder for each (repeated) analysis**.

Moreover, we have made appointments about naming the files.

We will not be storing data in an \"object store\" system.

We will not use a relational database system to store project data.

We will not use a graph database for data in the project.

We will not be storing data in a triple store.

### 3. What documentation and meta-data will accompany the data?

::: answer
List of data to be published is given in Section E, Question 9. This
also includes information about catalogs where the data can be found.
Information about data types used is given in Section A, Question 1.

## Section C: Ethics and Legal Compliance

::: {#q-ethical-issues .question}
### 4. How will you manage any ethical issues?

::: answer
#### Data we collect

We don\'t need any consent for collected data because those are not
personal.
:::
:::

::: {#q-ethical-issues .question}
### 5. How will you manage copyright and Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) issues?

::: answer
We will be working with the philosophy *as open as possible* for our
data.

The data cannot become completely open immediately because we want to
publish a paper first.

Data that is not legally restrained will be released after a fixed time
period, unconditionally.

All data will be owned by the Principal Investigator.

## Section D: Storage and Backup

::: {#q-store-backup .question}
### 6. How will the data be stored and backed up during the research?

::: answer
Storage needs are small at the beginning and will grow later.

All essential data is also stored elsewhere to prevent a total loss of
data. All project data stored outside of the working area will be
adequately backed up.

::: {#q-access-security .question}
### 7. How will you manage access and security?

::: answer
Only all project members have read/write access to the data.

## Section E: Selection and Preservation

::: {#q-which-longterm .question}
### 8. Which data are of long-term value and should be retained, shared, and/or preserved?

::: answer
We plan to produce the following datasets:

-   **(no name given)** (published) [--]{.separator} This data set will
    be kept available as long as technically possible. [--]{.separator}
    The metadata will be available even when the data no longer exists.

::: {#q-longterm-plan .question}
### 9. What is the longterm preservation plan for the dataset?

::: answer
-   **(no name given)** (published)

None of the used repositories charge for their services.

## Section F: Data Sharing

::: {#q-how-share .question}
### 10. How will you share the data?

::: answer
-   **(no name given)**

Information about used repositories (i.e. where will potential users
find out about the data) is provided in Section E, Question 9.

Embargo on the data is described in Section C, Question 5, and Section
F, Question 11.
:::
:::

::: {#q-restrictions .question}
### 11. Are any restrictions on data sharing required?

::: answer
Ethical and legal restrictions are documented under Section C. We have
used the Data Stewardship Wizard, which made us aware of options to
minimize the restrictions.

Data cannot be completely open due to legal reasons. But data that is
not legally restrained will be released after a fixed time period. The
embargo period will be After the submission and publication of a paper.

## Section G: Responsibilities and Resources

::: {#q-dm-responsible .question}
### 12. Who will be responsible for data management?

::: answer
Michael Addo is responsible for implementing the DMP, and ensuring it is
reviewed and revised.
:::
:::

::: {#q-required-resources .question}
### 13. What resources will you require to deliver your plan?

::: answer
To execute the DMP, no additional specialist expertise is required.

We require the following hardware or software in addition to what is
usually available in the institute: CyVerse Discovery Environment-VICE
Cyverse Data Store.

Charges applied by data repositories (if any) are mentioned already in
Section E, Question 9.
