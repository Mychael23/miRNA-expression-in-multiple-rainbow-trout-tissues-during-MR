### Background: 
Dietary methionine restriction (MR), for over 2 decades, has garnered interest in nutritional research due to its beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as increased insulin sensitivity and decreased lipid deposition. However, how dietary methionine restriction elicits such benefits is still under study. Recent studies have implicated
epigenetic factors such as miRNAs, as a target for the MR phenotype. In light of this discovery, few studies have been documented using non-model organisms like the teleost fish, rainbow trout, in methionine restriction research. For the studies that have, multiple tissues were not investigated for altered miRNA expression during methionine
restriction to elucidate the conservation of their function across different tissues.

### Main Objective: 
To investigate the effects of miRNA expression in insulin-dependent rainbow trout tissues on metabolism and insulin sensitivity during methionine restriction

### Methodology: 
This will be a cross-sectional study. A total of 16 juvenile rainbow trout would be used. Their growth rate and weight before and after the 8 week period would be used to determined. After the study period of 8 weeks of being fed specific dietary regimes, they will be euthanised, muscle, adipose and liver samples will be taken, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at âˆ’80C until analysis. RNA was extracted isolation of total RNA. From total RNA, MiRNA would be quantified. MiRanda 3.0 would be used to predict miRNA- gene interaction for the miRNA identified and quantified.

### Expected Outcomes:
The miRNA expression levels in various insulin dependent-tissues during methionine restriction would be classified. The miRNAs found in more than one tissue which is associated with the metabolic MR phenotype would be identified.
