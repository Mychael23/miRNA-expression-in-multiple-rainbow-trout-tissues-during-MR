# miRNA-expression-in-multiple-rainbow-trout-tissues-during-MR

### Background: 
Dietary methionine restriction (MR), for over 2 decades, has garnered interest in nutritional research due to its beneficial metabolic phenotypes such as increased insulin sensitivity and decreased lipid deposition. However, how dietary methionine restriction elicits such benefits is still under study. Recent studies have implicated epigenetic factors such as miRNAs, as a target for the MR phenotype. In light of this discovery, few studies have been documented using non-model organisms like the teleost fish, rainbow trout, in methionine restriction research. For the studies that have, multiple tissues were not investigated for altered miRNA expression during methionine restriction to elucidate the conservation of their function across different tissues. 

### Main Objective:
To investigate the effects of miRNA expression in insulin-dependent rainbow trout tissues on metabolism and insulin sensitivity during methionine restriction
